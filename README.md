# Two-Sample-T-Test-Shinny-App-
A R Shiny web app built for conducting a two-sample t-test easily

It might be painful to do a two-sample t-test for people with no statistical background because it involves several assumptions, even though this is a common statistical test. This project aims to solve this problem, allowing users to conduct the test swiftly from any data source. This project was accomplished by building a web application using the R shiny package. The data planned to compare should be in two variables in the input data, and users can decide which two to select. If the selected columns are characteristic, warning messages will appear. Also, the textbox can prevent users from picking more than two columns. Before the test, the assumptions will be tested beforehand, including the normality of the two variables (Shapiroâ€“Wilk test) and whether their variance is equal (Levene's test). If the sample size is larger than 300, we can assume normality, so only the equivalence of variance will be examined. Otherwise, we need to ensure the assumptions are not violated for small samples. If the assumption is not met, the p-value will not be calculated, and the app will show the caveat to the user. The types of t-tests to choose will depend on if the variance of the two variables is the same.
